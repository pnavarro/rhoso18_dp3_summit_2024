# Install and discover RHOSO using Gitops ArgoCD - Break & fix

Welcome to the Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) using ArgoCD lab instructions.
These instructions will guide you through the installation of the next generation of Red Hat's OpenStack product onto an existing OpenShift Cluster utilizing a bastion host and a single host for the data plane.

In this lab, you will use the following infrastructure:

* A 3 OCP controller + 3 OCP workers nodes 4.16 OCP cluster
* A bastion host to access to the OCP environment
* A RHEL 9.4 virtualised compute host

In this lab, you will cover the following topics:
