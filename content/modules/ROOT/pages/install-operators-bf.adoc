= Install the OpenStack Operator

== Using ArgoCD application to install RHOSO operators

The Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) IaaS services are implemented as a collection of Operators running on a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) cluster. These Operators manage the compute, storage, networking, and other services for your RHOSO cloud.

The OpenStack Operator (openstack-operator) installs all the required RHOSO service Operators and is the interface that you use to manage those Operators. 

The basic architecture of a Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) environment includes the following features:

* **Container-native application delivery**: RHOSO is delivered by using a container-native approach that spans the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) and RHEL platforms to deliver a container-native RHOSO deployment.
* **RHOCP-hosted services**: RHOCP hosts infrastructure services and RHOSO controller services by using RHOCP Operators to provide lifecycle management.
* **Ansible-managed RHEL-hosted service**: RHOSO workloads run on RHEL nodes that are managed by a dedicated DataPlane Operator. The DataPlane Operator runs Ansible jobs to configure the RHEL data plane nodes, such as the Compute nodes. RHOCP manages provisioning, DNS, and configuration management.
* **Installer-provisioned infrastructure**: The RHOSO installer enables installer-provisioned infrastructure that uses RHOSO bare-metal machine management to provision the Compute nodes for the RHOSO cloud.
* **User-provisioned infrastructure**: If you have your own machine ingest and provisioning workflow, you can use the RHOSO pre-provisioned model to add your pre-provisioned hardware into your RHOSO environment, while receiving the benefits of a container-native workflow.
* **Hosted RHOSO client**: RHOSO provides a host openstackclient pod that is preconfigured with administrator access to the deployed RHOSO environment.


Create an argocd application manifest to deploy the prerequisites for the RHOSO control plane installation:

. Review the pods in the **openstack-operators** namespace:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators
----

. If you run:
+
[source, bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
----
+
You should see a list of completed pods and then the running openstack services pods.
It should look like:
