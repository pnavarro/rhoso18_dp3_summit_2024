= Install the OpenStack Operator

. Clone the Files Repo
+
In the bastion terminal, clone the repo and change directory to the files that we will used later in the lab
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/pnavarro/showroom_osp-on-ocp-lb1374.git labrepo
cd labrepo/content/files/disconnected
----

. Install the OpenStack Operators
+
The next step in installing the *OpenStack Operators* will be create the *openstack-operators* project for the RHOSO operators:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project openstack-operators
----

. Create the `openstack` project for the deployed RHOSO environment:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project openstack
----
. Configure the **Catalog Source, OperatorGroup and Subscription** for the **OpenStack Operator** using your registry:
+
Create the new **CatalogSource, OperatorGroup, and Subscription** CRs in the **openstack** namespace from **files/openstack-operators.yaml**: You can cut and paste the referenced yamlfiles from the repo or you may wish to clone the repository onto the bastion which this guide will assume:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-openstack-operator.yaml
----
. Install the operator using the Manual approval strategy. Confirm that an install plan has been created but not executed as it has not been approved:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get installplan -n openstack-operators
----
.Sample Output
----
NAME            CSV                       APPROVAL   APPROVED
install-lfs4j   octavia-operator.v1.0.0   Manual     false
----
. Approve the installation of the operator by updating the approved field of the InstallPlan:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc patch installplan install-lfs4j  \
    --namespace openstack-operators \
    --type merge \
    --patch '{"spec":{"approved":true}}'
----

. Confirm that you have installed the Openstack Operator, *openstack-operator.openstack-operators*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get operators openstack-operator.openstack-operators
----

. Review the pods in the **openstack-operators** namespace:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators
----

. If you run:
+
[source, bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
----
+
You should see a list of completed pods and then the running openstack services pods.
It should look like:
